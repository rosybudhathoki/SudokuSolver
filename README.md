# SudukoSolver

This Python script utilizes backtracking, along with MRV and FA heuristics, to efficiently solve Sudoku puzzles. The Grid class represents the Sudoku grid, and the Backtracking class provides the search algorithm. Running times and success counts for MRV and FA are measured and plotted.
How to Run

    Ensure Python is installed.
    Run: python sudoku_solver.py

Results

    MRV Success: [Count]
    FA Success: [Count]
    MRV Time: [Time] seconds
    FA Time: [Time] seconds

A scatter plot (running_time_plot.png) illustrates the running times for both heuristics.
